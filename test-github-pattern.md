# Test GitHub Reference Pattern

This is a test file to see if the `@github #` pattern works in VS Code Copilot.

Let me try to reference an existing file:

@github #tooling/prettier/setup.md

Does this actually load the content of that file into the context?

Let me also try:

@github #tooling/vscode/settings.md
@github #tooling/dependabot.md

Can VS Code Copilot actually see and use these references?
