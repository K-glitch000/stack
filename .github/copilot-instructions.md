# Copilot Instructions for Daniel's Web Development Stack Reference

## Repository Purpose & Context

This repository serves as a curated collection of TypeScript-based web development configurations, prompts, and customizations. It's designed to:

1. **Provide AI assistants with context** for setting up new projects
2. **Serve as a personal reference** for Daniel's preferred stack configurations
3. **Help other developers** understand modern TypeScript-based development workflows

## Key Principles to Follow

### README Maintenance
- **Always keep the README.md synchronized** with repository structure changes
- When adding new stacks, frameworks, or tools, update the Technology Stack Overview section with appropriate badges
- Update the Repository Structure section to reflect new folders/files
- Maintain the established tone: professional but approachable, with personal touches

### Content Organization
- **Technology-first structure**: Organize by stack/framework (nextjs/, astro/, mobile/, etc.) rather than resource type
- Each technology folder should contain: `prompts/`, `configurations/`, `snippets/`, and `examples/` subfolders as needed
- **Prompt files** should be reusable and copy-pastable for other projects
- **Configuration files** should be detailed guides with step-by-step instructions

### AI-Assisted Development Philosophy
- Remember that Daniel uses AI as an **organizational and writing tool**, not for core engineering decisions
- Maintain transparency about AI involvement while emphasizing Daniel's independent technical capabilities
- When adding AI-related content, keep the tone consistent with the existing AI-Assisted Development section

### Writing Style & Tone
- **Professional but personal**: Include Daniel's perspective and experiences
- **Honest about limitations**: Don't oversell capabilities
- **Practical focus**: Emphasize real-world usage and problem-solving
- **ADHD-friendly**: Use clear structure, bullet points, and logical organization

## Specific Tasks When Updating

### Adding New Technologies
1. Add appropriate badge to Technology Stack Overview using reference-style links
2. Update the badge references section at the bottom of README.md
3. Add folder structure to Repository Structure section
4. Include brief description of when/why Daniel uses this technology

### Adding New Content
1. Ensure new content fits the established folder structure
2. Update relevant sections in README.md to reflect new capabilities
3. Maintain consistency with existing documentation style
4. Consider if new content requires updates to the "How to Use This Repository" section

### Review Requests
When asked to review the repository:
1. Check if README.md accurately reflects current repository structure
2. Verify that all mentioned technologies have corresponding folders/content
3. Ensure badge references are working and up-to-date
4. Confirm that new content follows the established patterns

## Technology Stack Context

Daniel's current focus areas (update as needed):
- **Frontend**: Next.js (primary), Astro (static sites), React, Vite
- **Mobile**: PWA, Capacitor, Expo/React Native
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB with Drizzle/Prisma ORMs
- **Deployment**: Vercel (primary), Kubernetes, Docker
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Figma-to-code workflows

## Communication Guidelines

- **Be respectful and collaborative** (Daniel believes this improves AI interactions)
- **Ask clarifying questions** when repository organization or content direction is unclear
- **Suggest improvements** to structure or documentation when you see opportunities
- **Maintain the established voice** from the existing README content

## Meta-Notes

- This file itself exemplifies the repository's purpose: providing context for AI assistants
- Updates to this instruction file should be rare and significant
- Remember that Daniel is comfortable with the collaborative AI writing process described in the README
