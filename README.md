- **Configuration Templates**: Use ready-made configurations for various frameworks and libraries.
- **AI Assistance**: Enhance your development experience with prompts tailored for AI tools like Copilot.
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry best practices to ensure high-quality code.
- **Customizations**: Easily modify the configurations to fit your project needs.

## Getting Started

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start using the configurations and templates. Here are some examples of how to use them:

### TypeScript Boilerplate

To create a new TypeScript project, use the boilerplate provided in the `boilerplates` folder. You can copy the necessary files and customize them as needed.

### Configuration Templates

Each configuration template is located in the `configs` folder. Choose a template that suits your project and follow the instructions provided in the README files within each folder.
